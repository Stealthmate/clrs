# Q

Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

# A

Games require algorithms for AI-related stuff:

- Chess bots need to compute the best move.
- FPS game bots need to compute a strategy, find a path towards their goal, etc.
- Factorio needs algorithms to compute fluid and train movement.
