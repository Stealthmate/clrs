# A

## a

Each list is sorted in $\Theta(k^2)$ time and there are $\frac{n}{k}$ lists, so the total time is $T = \Theta(k^2) * \frac{n}{k} = \Theta(nk)$.

## b [2]

We have $\frac{n}{k}$ lists, each with $k$ members and we can merge them pair by pair. Thus we have $\lg\frac{n}{k}$ merge levels and for each level we merge $n$ elements, therefore the total time is $\Theta(n\lg\frac{n}{k})$.

## c

With $k = \Theta(\lg n)$ we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Theta(n\lg n + n\lg(\frac{n}{\lg n} &= \Theta(n\lg n + n(\lg n - \lg^2 n)) \\
&= \Theta(2n\lg n - n\lg^2 n)
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $n\lg n > n\lg^2 n$, so the final time is $\Theta(n\lg n)$

## d

Test for which values of $k$ insertion beats merge and set it to that.
