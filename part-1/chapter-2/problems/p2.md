# A

## a

Prove the the elements of $A\prime$ are actually the elements of $A$.

## b

### Invariant

Before each iteration, the element A'[j] is smaller than all other elements A[k] for k > j.

### Initialization

Before j = A.length - 1, the statement is trivially true.

### Maintenance

Suppose the invariant holds before j = k. That is, element A[k] is smaller than all other elements after it. On the j-th iteration, if A[j - 1] is smaller than A[j], then they are exchanged, and thus A[j-1] is now smaller than all other elements after it.

### Termination

The loop terminates when j = i. Thus at the end of the loop, A[i] is smaller than all A[k] for k > i.

## c

### Invariant

Before each iteration, the subarray A'[0..i] contains the smallest i elements of A in sorted order.

### Initialization

Before i = 0, the invariant is vacuously true.

### Maintenance

Assume the invariant holds before i = k. In the k-th iteration, the inner loop ensures that A[k] is smaller than all A[j] for j > k. But by hypothesis A[k] is also not smaller than A[j] for j < k. Thus A[0..k+1] now contains the smallest k+1 elements of A in sorted order.

### Termination

The loop terminates when i = A.length, which means that at the end, A[0..A.length]=A now contains all the elements of A in sorted order.

## d

Bubblesort performs exactly

$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

iterations regardless of the state of the input, so the worst case time is the same as the best and average case time, namely $\Theta(n^2)$.
