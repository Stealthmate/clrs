## a

(2, 1)
(3, 1)
(8, 6)
(8, 1)
(6, 1)

## b

The array [n, n-1, ..., 1], because every element is in an inversion with every element after it. Thus there are $(n - 1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = \frac{n(n-1)}/{2}$.

## c

The number of times the internal loop executes is equal to the number of inversions that the currently considered element is in.

## d
